  I'm a father, project manager and problem solver living in sunny San Diego. My trajectory has taken me from developer to project manager and back again a multitude of times. My greatest successes emerge when solving complex problems and leading teams to create amazing things. If I'm surrounded by inspired and funny people who are passionate about solving problems, I'm a happy camper.

            My team was soely responsible for delivering extremely popular features such as math rendering in github, and the ability to render mermaid diagrams. Along with these features, we embarked on a 2 year project to deprecated a neglected service that had more security vulnerabilties than a sticky note with passwords on it. 

            Currently my team is embedded in the Copilot organization, enabling user management and billing capabilities to businesses and individuals wanting to use the cornucopia of AI products we offer.
